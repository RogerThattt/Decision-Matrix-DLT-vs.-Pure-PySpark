# Decision-Matrix-DLT-vs.-Pure-PySpark

Decision Matrix – DLT vs. Pure PySpark
Decision Factor	DLT (Delta Live Tables)	Pure PySpark
Team Skillset	SQL-first teams, limited PySpark/Scala expertise	Strong PySpark/Scala engineering skills
Pipeline Complexity	Moderate transformations with clear dependencies (bronze → silver → gold)	Highly complex, custom logic, iterative algorithms
Data Quality Enforcement	Built-in EXPECT constraints, automatic quarantine of bad records	Must code quality checks manually
Orchestration	Declarative DAG creation (define end states, DLT handles order)	Manual ordering of transformations
Streaming Support	Handles streaming + batch with same code	Requires explicit streaming vs batch logic
Lineage & Auditing	Automatic lineage & monitoring	Must build lineage tracking manually
Incremental Processing	Built-in state management for incremental loads	Manual watermarking and deduplication
Operational Overhead	Low – automatic retries, monitoring, recovery	Higher – must handle job orchestration & failures
Cost Optimization	Works well with serverless compute for lower ops cost	More flexibility in cluster tuning for cost control
Performance Tuning	Limited manual tuning; DLT optimizes automatically	Full control over partitions, caching, execution plan
Prototyping Speed	Very fast to go from notebook → production	Slower – more boilerplate and config needed
Customization Needs	Less flexible for edge-case transformations	Highly flexible – full PySpark API access
Compliance & Governance	Strong fit when data lineage & constraints are mandatory	Possible, but needs custom frameworks
When Not Ideal	- Extremely large, complex transformations with fine-grained tuning
- Heavy ML preprocessing pipelines	- When you need fast, low-maintenance, SQL-first pipelines
- When data quality rules are complex but declarative

✅ Use DLT when:

Your team wants SQL-first, declarative pipelines with built-in quality, lineage, and orchestration.

You want fast prototype-to-prod transitions.

You need streaming + batch with minimal extra code.

⚠ Use Pure PySpark when:

You need full control over transformations, execution plans, and performance tuning.

Pipelines are highly custom, iterative, or algorithm-heavy (e.g., ML feature engineering).

You want to avoid DLT’s Serverless Compute requirement for certain features in the future.
